## Installation

Delve is packaged as a Ruby gem, so installation is a simple as

## Bootstrapping a Roguelike

Delve allows you to bootstrap your roguelike, with a simple game that includes a main screen and a game screen, with an _@ walking around the world_ demo game that you can extend.

To generate your Roguelike, run

    $ delve -n my-roguelike

You can also see the current installed version of delve by running
